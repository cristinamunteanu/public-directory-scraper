# Development Log

## 2026-06-01

Built a minimal Python project skeleton for small-step scraper development.

Why this structure:
- `src/` keeps package code separate from tests and project files.
- `tests/` gives the project an immediate validation loop.
- No scraper logic or third-party runtime dependencies were added yet.

How to test:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Known limitations:
- No scraping behavior exists yet.
- The first real feature should start in core logic before any CLI or UI layer.

## 2026-06-02

Built the first vertical slice: a runnable package entrypoint.

Why this structure:
- `__main__.py` keeps the visible command behavior small and easy to test.
- The subprocess test verifies the same module execution path a user runs manually.

How to test:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m public_directory_scraper
```

Known limitations:
- The command only prints the package name and version.
- No scraping, parsing, fetching, or file output exists yet.
